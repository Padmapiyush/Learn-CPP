# Function in C++:

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. In C++, a function is declared using the following syntax:

```cpp
return_type function_name(parameters) {
   // code to be executed
   return value; // optional
}
```
- `return_type` : specifies the data type of the value returned by the function. If the function does not return a value, the return type is void.
- `function_name` : specifies the name of the function.
- `parameters` : specifies the input values to the function. If the function does not require any input values, the parentheses can be left empty.
- `return value` : specifies the value returned by the function. This is optional.

Example of a function in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int sum(int a, int b) {
   int result = a + b;
   return result;
}

int main() {
   int x = 10, y = 20;
   int result = sum(x, y);
   cout << "The sum of " << x << " and " << y << " is " << result << endl;
   return 0;
}
```

# Recursion in C++:

Recursion is a powerful technique in computer programming that involves a function calling itself. This technique can be used to solve complex problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved recursively.
In C++, recursion is implemented using a function that calls itself with a different set of parameters, thus breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. The function continues to call itself until it reaches a base case, which is the simplest case that can be solved without recursion. The base case is used to terminate the recursion and return a final result.

The general structure of a recursive function in C++ is:

```cpp
return_type function_name(parameters) {
  if (base_case) {
    // return the base case value
  } else {
    // break the problem into smaller subproblems and call the function recursively
    return function_name(smaller_parameters);
  }
}
```

The recursive function begins with an if statement that checks for the base case. If the base case is true, the function returns a value. Otherwise, the function breaks the problem down into smaller subproblems and calls itself recursively with the smaller parameters. This process continues until the base case is reached.

A common example of a recursive function is the factorial function, which is defined as:

```cpp
int factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
```

In this function, the base case is when `n` equals `0`. If the base case is true, the function returns 1. If the base case is false, the function calculates the factorial of `n-1` by calling itself recursively and multiplies the result by `n`.

Recursion can be a powerful tool in programming, but it's important to use it carefully to avoid infinite loops or excessive memory usage. It's also important to consider the performance of recursive functions, as they can be less efficient than iterative solutions in some cases.
