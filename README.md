# Roadmap to learn C++

## 1. Learn the basics of programming: 
Before starting with C++, it's important to have a good understanding of the **basics of programming** such as:
* [variables](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-CPP/tree/main/1.%20Learn%20the%20basics%20of%20C%2B%2B#variables), 
* [data types](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-CPP/tree/main/1.%20Learn%20the%20basics%20of%20C%2B%2B#data-types), 
* [operators](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-CPP/tree/main/1.%20Learn%20the%20basics%20of%20C%2B%2B#operators), 
* [control structures](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-CPP/tree/main/1.%20Learn%20the%20basics%20of%20C%2B%2B#1-conditional-statements),
* [Switch](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-CPP/tree/main/1.%20Learn%20the%20basics%20of%20C%2B%2B#2-switch-statements),
* [loops](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-CPP/tree/main/1.%20Learn%20the%20basics%20of%20C%2B%2B#3-loops), 
* [functions](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-CPP/tree/main/2.%20Function%20and%20Recursion#function-in-c), and 
* [object-oriented programming concepts](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-CPP/tree/main/3.%20OOPS#object-oriented-programming-oop).

## 2. Learn the syntax of C++:
Once you have a good understanding of programming basics, you can start learning the **syntax of C++**. This includes learning about 
* C++ data types, 
* control structures, 
* functions, and 
* classes.

## 3. Learn C++ libraries and frameworks:
C++ has a vast number of libraries and frameworks available that can help you build complex applications easily. It's important to learn at least one of the **popular libraries** such as:
* Boost, 
* STL, or 
* Qt.

## 4. Learn data structures and algorithms:
Data structures and algorithms are important to learn in any programming language, including C++. Learning 
- [**data structures**](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Data%20Structures) such as :
  - arrays, 
  - linked lists,
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - trees
  - graphs, and 
 - [**algorithms**](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Algorithms) such as : 
   - sorting, 
   - searching, and 
 - [dynamic programming](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Dynamic%20Programming) <br><br>
 will help you write efficient and optimized code.

## 5. Practice writing code:
`Practice` writing `code regularly` to gain more proficiency in the language. Start with small programs and gradually move on to `more complex projects`. `Participate in coding challenges and competitions   to test your skills.

## 6. Read C++ books and online resources: 
There are many good books and online resources available for learning C++. Some of the popular books are  `C++ Primer` by Lippman, Lajoie, and Moo, `The C++ Programming Language` by Bjarne Stroustrup, and `Effective C++` by Scott Meyers.

## 7. Join a community:
Join a community of C++ developers to learn from experienced programmers, get help with programming problems, and `network with other developers`.

## 8. Learn best practices:
Learning best practices such as clean code, `version control`, and `code reviews` can help you write better and maintainable code.

## 9. Build a portfolio:
Building `a portfolio` of C++ projects can help you showcase your skills to potential employers or clients. Include small and large projects that demonstrate your proficiency in C++.

## 10. Keep learning:
C++ is a vast language, and there is always more to learn. Keep learning by following the `latest trends` and updates in the language, attending conferences and `workshops`, and reading blogs and articles written by experts in the field.
